# Python_Graphics_Animation
These are the Python Programs from the book "Python Graphics for Games 2: Animation" by Mike Ohlson de Fine.
This is the Python code used in the second of a series of books titled "Python Graphics for Games" whose aim is to provide tools to help you develop your ideas for making games and simulations.
All the code has been successfully run on Python version 2.7.2 and version 3.2.3

Who is this book for? Young men and women mainly. I am thinking of high school students somewhere in Africa, South America and the East who want to create interesting, entertaining and brain stretching drawings that can move. They can be poor. No software needs to be purchased. A computer, a Linux operating system (free) and a 4Gigabyte memory stick are all that are needed. The memory stick is to be able to download free software like Inkscape and install them on your computer.

The programs are intended to serve the following purposes:
Present the simplest programs for making drawn shapes appear to move.
Illustrate methods of improving the visual authenticity of animations.
Provide techniques for controlling the speed of animation. 
Develop methods for animating changes in the shape of objects (morphing).
Develop ways of animating changes in color of shapes.
Creating a unique drawing tool with user designed tools.
Interfacing SVG drawings as a Python tool.
